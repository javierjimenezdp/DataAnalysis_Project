# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales and return transactions to identify suspicious patterns that may indicate fraudulent activities. The analysis leverages various techniques, including data cleaning, anomaly detection, and data visualization.

## Objectives
- Identify and analyze anomalies in sales and return transactions.
- Understand customer behavior concerning purchases and returns.
- Provide insights that could help in fraud detection and inventory management.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
