# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to perform data analysis on sales data to identify potential anomalies in product quantities. The analysis uses various techniques, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and anomaly detection through the Isolation Forest model.

## Objective
The main goal is to analyze sales data, identify suspicious transaction patterns, and detect anomalies in product quantities.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```
3. Load your CSV file containing sales data.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the analysis.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Loading**: Load sales data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Handling Null Values**: Identify and impute null values in the dataset.
3. **Data Analysis**: Group data by relevant metrics (e.g., stock code, customer ID).
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Implement the Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies in quantities.
5. **Visualization**: Visualize results to better understand trends and anomalies.

## Analysis Examples
- **Relationship between Dates and Quantities**: Analyze daily sales volumes.
- **Relationship between Users and Sales Volumes**: Understand purchase volumes per customer.
- **Anomaly Detection Visualization**: Visualize quantities over time with detected anomalies highlighted.
